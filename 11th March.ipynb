    "\n",
    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to evaluate whether a sample differs significantly from a population or to compare two samples.\n",
    "However, the main difference between them is the underlying assumptions about the population and sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "In a t-test, we use the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation. \n",
    "A t-test also assumes that the population is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) and the population standard deviation is known or can be estimated.\n",
    "A z-test assumes that the population is normally distributed.\n",

    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose a researcher wants to compare the mean height of two groups of students, one group from a private school and the other from a public school. \n",
    "If the researcher has access to the population standard deviation, they can use a z-test. \n",
    "However, if the population standard deviation is not known and the sample sizes are relatively small, the researcher would use a t-test.\n",

    "The main difference between them is the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is directional, meaning it specifies the direction of the effect being tested. \n",
    "This type of test is used when the researcher is interested in testing for the existence of an effect in a particular direction. \n",
    "For example, a one-tailed test could be used to determine if a new drug improves a specific health condition more than a placebo. \n",
    "The alternative hypothesis for this test would be that the new drug is better than the placebo in treating the health condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tailed test, on the other hand, is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is non-directional, meaning it specifies that there is a difference between the two groups being compared, but not the direction of the difference.\n",
    "This type of test is used when the researcher is interested in testing if there is a difference between two groups, but is not sure about the direction of the effect.\n",
    "For example, a two-tailed test could be used to determine if there is a difference in the average weight between men and women. \n",
    "The alternative hypothesis for this test would be that the mean weight of men is not equal to the mean weight of women.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests is the direction of the alternative hypothesis. \n",
    "One-tailed tests are used when the researcher has a specific directional hypothesis, while two-tailed tests are used when the researcher is interested in testing for the presence of any difference, regardless of direction.\n",

    "The researcher is specifically interested in testing this directional hypothesis.\n",

    "In hypothesis testing, Type 1 and Type 2 errors are two types of errors that can occur when testing a statistical hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 error, also known as a false positive error, occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. \n",

    "This means that we fail to identify a significant difference or effect, when in reality there is such a difference or effect. \n",
    "The probability of making a Type 2 error is denoted by the Greek letter beta (β) and is related to the power of the test, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n",

    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose a researcher is testing a new drug to see if it lowers cholesterol levels.\n",

    "The null hypothesis is that the drug has no effect on cholesterol levels, while the alternative hypothesis is that the drug lowers cholesterol levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Type 1 error occurs if the researcher rejects the null hypothesis when it is actually true, meaning they conclude that the drug lowers cholesterol levels when it does not. \n",
    "In this scenario, the researcher would mistakenly conclude that the drug is effective in lowering cholesterol levels, and the error would be a false positive. \n",
    "This can lead to unnecessary costs and potentially harmful side effects if the drug is prescribed to people who do not need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Type 2 error occurs if the researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false, meaning they conclude that the drug has no effect on cholesterol levels when it actually does lower cholesterol levels.\n",

    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update or revise the probability of an event based on new information.\n",
    "It was named after the 18th-century English statistician Thomas Bayes.\n",

    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "An example of Bayes's theorem in action is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a medical test has a 95% sensitivity and a 99% specificity for a certain disease. \n",
    "This means that the test correctly identifies 95% of people who have the disease, and it correctly identifies 99% of people who do not have the disease. \n",
    "Suppose further that the prevalence of the disease in the population is 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose a person takes the medical test and tests positive for the disease. What is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes's theorem, we can calculate the conditional probability of having the disease given a positive test result as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive Test) = (P(Positive Test|Disease) * P(Disease)) / P(Positive Test)\n",

    "P(Positive Test) = P(Positive Test|Disease) * P(Disease) + P(Positive Test|No Disease) * P(No Disease)\n",

    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain degree of confidence. \n",
    "In other words, it is an estimate of the interval within which the true value of a parameter lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, we first need to specify the level of confidence we want to use.\n",
    "Common levels of confidence include 90%, 95%, and 99%. A 95% confidence interval means that if we repeated the experiment many times, we would expect the true parameter value to lie within the interval 95% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the confidence interval, we use the sample statistics and the appropriate distribution for the parameter being estimated.\n",
    "For example, if we are estimating the mean of a population, we can use the t-distribution if the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown, or the normal distribution if the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to calculate a confidence interval for the mean using the t-distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to estimate the mean height of a certain population. \n",
    "We take a random sample of 50 individuals and measure their heights. The sample mean is 170 cm and the sample standard deviation is 5 cm. \n",
    "We want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the t-distribution with 49 degrees of freedom (i.e., the sample size minus 1), the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 2.009.\n",
    "We can then calculate the margin of error as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of error = t * (standard error of the mean)\n",
